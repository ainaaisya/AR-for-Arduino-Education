## Hi there!
# AR for Arduino Education Project

This README provides instructions for users and developers to explore the "AR for Arduino Education" project. The project features an APK file that allows users to experience augmented reality for Arduino education.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- You have an **Android device** to run the APK file. This project is only compatible with Android devices.
- Sufficient storage space on your device for the APK and associated assets.
- Basic understanding of AR (Augmented Reality) technology and Arduino components is helpful but not mandatory, so have fun!

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Blend**: Contains Blender files used for creating 3D models.
- **Build**: Includes the APK file for the project. Users can download and install this file on their Android devices.
- **Model**: Stores 3D models used in the application.
- **Scenes**: Holds Unity scene files for the AR application.
- **Scripting**: Contains Unity C# scripts that control the applicationâ€™s behavior.

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Download the APK

Navigate to the **Build** folder and download the APK file to your Android device.

### Step 2: Install the APK

1. Transfer the APK file to your Android device if downloaded on a different device.
2. On your Android device, locate the APK file.
3. Enable installation from unknown sources (if not already enabled) in your device settings.
4. Tap on the APK file to install the application.

### Step 3: Launch the Application

After installation, open the app and explore its features. The application provides AR-based learning for Arduino, allowing users to interact with virtual components.

## Credits

This project was solely developed by **Aina Aisya** as part of a final year project at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS). Special thanks to the following teammates for their invaluable support and contributions: **Jacyntha Eleanor, Anrianih Yusof, Nurul Fatihah, and Nur Izzatul Natasha**.

The success of this project relied on teamwork and dedication, but the core implementation and overall coding were led by Aina Aisya.
