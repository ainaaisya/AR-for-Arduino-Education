## Hi there!

# AR for Arduino Education Project

This repository contains resources for the **AR for Arduino Education** project. It is an individual project developed by **Aina Aisya** as part of her final year requirement at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS). The application leverages Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance learning and engagement with Arduino concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **Blend**: Contains Blender files used for 3D modeling in the project.
- **Build**: Includes the APK file of the AR application.  
  - **Note**: Users can download the APK file from this folder and install it on their Android devices to test the AR experience.
- **Model**: Stores 3D model files (e.g., `.fbx`, `.obj`) used in the AR application.
- **Scenes**: Contains Unity scene files used to design and develop the application.
- **Scripting**: Includes Unity scripts (C#) for implementing application logic.
- **testing.txt**: May contain test notes.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Download the APK**  
   Navigate to the `Build` folder and download the APK file.

2. **Install the APK**  
   Transfer the APK file to your Android device and install it. Ensure that your device allows installations from unknown sources.

3. **Launch the Application**  
   Open the app on your Android device. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the AR content.

4. **Explore the Features**  
   The application provides an interactive AR experience to learn Arduino concepts. Use a compatible AR marker or follow the app's instructions to explore.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository or modify the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Unity 3D**: Version used for development (recommend matching the version).
- **Blender**: For editing the 3D models.
- **Android Studio** (optional): For advanced debugging and customization of the APK.

## Acknowledgments

This project is solely the work of **Aina Aisya** for her final year project at UNIMAS. It reflects her dedication and effort to integrate Augmented Reality into Arduino education. Special thanks to the lecturers and peers who provided guidance and feedback throughout the project.
